////One Java project can have one main class only.
//// Java doesn't allow to write any method or variable (like global variable, function in C) outside the class, thats why java is a pure OOP language.
//// No standalone function, everything is a part of class
//// No explicit use of pointer, uses reference.
//
//class _1_HelloWorld {       //  good to write class name's first letter in Capital
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        // good to write variable and method name in smaller letter with camelcasing or _
//        String $name = "Win";   // can write $ and _ at the beginning of variable, but variable can't start with number.
//        double PI = 3.1416;     // good practice to write constants in ALL CAPITAL
//        System.out.println("Help! " + $name + " " + PI);
//    }
//}
//
//// One java file can only have one public class, otherwise, it will be treated as separate files.

//3. What is JVM?
