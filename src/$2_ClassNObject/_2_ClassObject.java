/* Key Takeaways
// A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines what should be in each object and how each object should behave.
// An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior of a class. objects are often used to model the real-world.
// a class is a template for an object,
// and an object is an instance of a class.
// Class allows a function/method inside it which is the one of the main property of an OOP Language, than a Structured language such as, C.
// Class variables are called = attributes/properties/instance_variables.
// each instance of the class (that is, each object of the class) contains its own copy of these variables.
// Thus, the data for one object is separate and unique from the data for another.
// Class functions are called = methods
// As a general rule, it is the methods that determine how a classâ€™ data can be used.
// We can write many classes in 1 java class file at the same level. which can not be public. only the main java class of the file can be public
