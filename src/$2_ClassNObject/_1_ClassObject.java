/* Key Takeaways
// A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines what should be in each object and how each object should behave.
// An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior of a class. objects are often used to model the real-world.
// a class is a template for an object,
// and an object is an instance of a class.
// Class allows a function/method inside it which is the one of the main property of an OOP Language, than a Structured language such as, C.
// Class variables are called = attributes/properties/instance_variables.
// each instance of the class (that is, each object of the class) contains its own copy of these variables.
// Thus, the data for one object is separate and unique from the data for another.
// Class functions are called = Methods
// As a general rule, it is the Methods that determine how a classâ€™ data can be used.
// We can write many classes in 1 java class file at the same level. which can not be public. only the main java class of the file can be public

1. Why JRE is set on IDE, but JDK is not? Difference between JDK and JRE?

2. How to generate Random strings in Java??
